Projects

1. Exam Application
HTML | CSS | Javascript | Bootstrap
The website allows users to take a test of multiple choice questions to test their knowledge on various programming languages. You can also see your previous score to compare with your current score. Each test is of 10 minutes duration and to prevent any malpractice, selection of text is disabled and the window goes fullscreen during the test.

2. Face Tracking using Mediapipe
Python | OpenCV | Mediapipe
The aim of the project is to track a human face and form a mesh. This project uses a machine learning framework Mediapipe that takes camera input and estimates around 468 3D face landmarks in real-time. The ouput is a face mesh with various landmarks that are actively being tracked. These landmarks can be used to identify facial movements, expression change, eyes close and open, and many other observations can be made.

3. Portfolio Website
HTML | CSS | JavaScrip | React | Bootstrap
A portfolio website project is a digital platform that showcases a person's professional work and accomplishments in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.
